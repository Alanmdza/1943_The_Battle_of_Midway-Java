# 1943: The Battle of Midway - Inspired Java Game


This repository contains my final project for the Object Oriented Programming subject of the Computer Engineering degree. The goal of this project was to create a Java game inspired by the classic game "1943" for the NES.
The game is a modern adaptation of the "1943" airplane game. It is developed in Java and uses object-oriented programming principles to organize and manage game elements.
